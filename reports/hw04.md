**Results**

*Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code. What did you think was important to do to make it easy to test the program. What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignment.*

> When designing the functions to make calls to the GitHub APIs, it was important to keep in mind the different stages at which the program could fail. This is particularly important when wrinting code with testing in mind because it helps iscolate the points of failure to finite sections of code which can be more easily tested. This also makes tests more comprenhensive since individual features can be tested indivdually.

> Some of the challenges I face when testing this assignment involved counting up the total commits for a given repository. This is becasue the commit count must be done by accessing a field on an array of JSON objects rather than the natural result of a single API call. Additional issues arose with API limits since the number of repositories associated with my GitHub account only allowed me to test a handful of times.
